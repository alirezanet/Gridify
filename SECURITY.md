## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it to us privately to allow time for remediation.

### How to Report

1. **Private Disclosure:** Use GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature to report a vulnerability. This ensures the report remains private and secure. You can create a private security advisory [here](https://github.com/alirezanet/Gridify/security/advisories/new).

### Reporting Guidelines

- **Expected Response Time:** We aim to acknowledge vulnerability reports within 7 days. Actual resolution times may vary depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.
- **After Reporting:** Once a vulnerability is reported, we will acknowledge the report and provide regular updates until the issue is resolved. If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be prioritized and patched in a timely manner. If declined, we will provide a clear reason for the decision.

Please do not disclose any security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
