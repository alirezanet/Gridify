# Extensions

The Gridify library adds below extension methods to `IQueryable` objects.

All Gridify extension methods can accept [GridifyQuery](./gridifyQuery.md) and [GridifyMapper](./gridifyMapper.md) as a parameter.
Make sure to checkout the documentation of these classes for more information.

::: tip
If you want to use Gridify extension methods on an `IEnumerable` object, use `.AsQueryable()` first.

## ApplyFiltering

You can use this method if you want to only apply **filtering** on a `IQueriable` or `DbSet`.

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.ApplyFiltering("name = John");
```

this is completely equivalent to the bellow LINQ query:

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.Where(p => p.Name == "John");
```

the main difference is in the first example, we are using a string to filter, that can be dynamicly generated or passed from end-user but in the second example, we should hard code the query for supported fields.

Checkout the [Filtering Operators](./filtering.md) section for more information.

## ApplyOrdering

You can use this method if you want to only apply **ordering** on an `IQueriable` collection or `DbSet`.

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.ApplyOrdering("name, age desc");
```

this is completely equivalent to the bellow LINQ query:

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.OrderBy(x => x.Name).ThenByDescending(x => x.Age);
```

Checkout the [Ordering](./ordering.md) section for more information.

## ApplyPaging

You can use this method if you want to only apply **paging** on an `IQueryable` collection or `DbSet`.

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.ApplyPaging(3, 20);
```

this is completely equivalent to the bellow LINQ query:

``` csharp
var query = personsRepo.Skip((3-1) * 20).Take(20);
```

## ApplyFilteringAndOrdering

You can use this method if you want to apply **filtering** and **ordering** on an `IQueryable` collection or `DbSet`. This method accepts `IGridifyQuery`.

## ApplyOrderingAndPaging

You can use this method if you want to apply **ordering** and **paging** on an `IQueryable` collection or `DbSet`. This method accepts `IGridifyQuery`.

## ApplyFilteringOrderingPaging

You can use this method if you want to apply  **filtering** and **ordering** and **paging** on a `IQueryable` collection or `DbSet`. This method accepts `IGridifyQuery`.

## GridifyQueryable

Like [ApplyFilteringOrderingPaging](#ApplyFilteringOrderingPaging) but it returns a `QueryablePaging<T>` that have an extra `int Count` value that can be used for pagination.

## Gridify

This is an ALL-IN-ONE package, it accepts `IGridifyQuery`, applies filtering, ordering, and paging, and returns a `Paging<T>` object.
This method is completely optimized to be used with any **Grid** component.
